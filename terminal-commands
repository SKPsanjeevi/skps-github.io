du -sh *

** Given an input, sorting can be done using ``sort``. For example, ``du -sh *`` can be piped to
``sort`` as
du -sh * | sort -h
Here, ``-h`` flag compares human readable numbers (e.g., 2K 1G) which are outputted from ``du -sh *``.

** Count number of lines of a piped output using:
wc -l

** Say you want to see a simulation is complete by checking an output file or last lines of a file.
Without actually opening the file, 
tail -n <N>

** less

** Compress files/folder using tar
tar -zcvf 
tar -zxvf

** -exec is a powerful

** pipe output a file or append output to a file using > and >>
