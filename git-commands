1. Rename a branch:
git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>

or simply
git branch -m <new-name>

2. Delete a branch
git branch -d <branch-name>

(Not recommended) if you would like to force-delete
git branch -D <branch-name>


3. Collapsing multiple commits into one commit
git rebase -i HEAD~<N>


4. Benefits of integration?!?

- List all commits since beginning of the branch (assuming branched from `master` and make sure
`master` is not outdated:

git log master..myBranch

The above command with compressed output:
git log --oneline master..myBranch
